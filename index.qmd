Hello and welcome to my website!

As a data science student, I enjoy making sense of our complex world through numbers and models. My interests include working with all sorts of datasets, making cool data visualizations, and teaching data science, just to name a few. I also studied computational linguistics and have experience fine-tuning large language models.

In my free time, I like to learn Japanese, work on puzzles and brain teasers, and listen to music!
