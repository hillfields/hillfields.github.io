Hello and welcome to my website!

I enjoy making sense of our complex world through numbers and models. My interests include making interpretable data visualizations, training machine learning models, and teaching data science, just to name a few. I also studied computational linguistics and have experience working with large language models.

In my free time, I enjoy learning Japanese, tinkering with puzzles, and listening to music!
