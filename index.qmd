Hello and welcome to my website!

As a data science student, I enjoy making sense of our complex world through numbers and models. My interests include working with a wide variety of datasets, making cool data visualizations, and teaching data science, just to name a few. I also studied computational linguistics and have experience fine-tuning large language models. Check out some of my work by clicking on the **Projects** tab above!

In my free time, I like to learn Japanese, work on puzzles and brain teasers, play video games (mainly Honkai: Star Rail), and listen to music!
