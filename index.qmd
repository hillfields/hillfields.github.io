```{r, include=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)

python_text <- function() text_spec("Python", color = "green")
r_text <- function() text_spec("R", color = "#ff9600")
sql_text <- function() text_spec("SQL", color = "#5bb0ff")

I enjoy making data more interpretable, especially making cool data visualizations and teaching data science. In my free time, I like to learn Japanese, work on puzzles and brain teasers, and listen to music.
