## About

I am a Statistics & Data Science major and Linguistics minor at UCSB. Currently, I serve as an Undergraduate Learning Assistant for both the PSTAT and CMPSC departments, helping students in introductory statistics and data science classes. I am also part of this year's data science capstone and will be working on an upcoming project with the [MOVE Lab](http://move.geog.ucsb.edu/).

As for coding experience, I am most familiar with R and Python, though I have some knowledge of SQLite and Java from my [coursework](courses.html). I put a lot of emphasis on making my code readable, which not only helps my future self but also other people understand what I'm doing.

I enjoy applying my programming skills to areas beyond data analysis as well. I am a 3-time recipient of the [Creative Computing Scholarship](https://summer.ucsb.edu/courses/course-spotlight/creative-computing), which has given me the opportunity to learn how technology can be uniquely integrated in different domains -- see some of these projects [here](projects.html#creative-coding).

Outside of class, my interests include listening to music and learning Japanese.
