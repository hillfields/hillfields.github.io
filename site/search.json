I also have a page dedicated to my projects.\nI am currently an Undergraduate Learning Assistant for both the PSTAT and CMPSC departments, helping students in introductory statistics and data science classes.\nI am also a 3-time recipient of the Creative Computing Scholarship, which has given me the opportunity to learn how technology can be uniquely integrated in different domains – see some of these projects here."
