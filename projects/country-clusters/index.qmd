## About

This is a vignette (essentially a step-by-step guide) that uses unlabeled country data to demonstrate the following clustering methods:

-   **Hierarchical (Euclidean distance):** clusters are formed based on the distance between observations
-   **Model-based (Gaussian mixture models):** clusters are formed based on a probability distribution
-   **Density-based clustering (DBSCAN):** clusters are formed where many points are close together

Overall, the model-based clustering method gave us the most detailed clusters (groups based on socio-economic and health conditions) while still maintaining a good level of interpretability.
