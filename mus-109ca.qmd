Over the course of 6 weeks, I learned how to use [Max](https://cycling74.com/products/max), a visual programming environment for music and multimedia. Despite not having much knowledge in music theory/production, I came out of this class with several projects that I am quite proud of.

## Assignment 1: Note Generator

Generates random notes within a major scale, with the scale changing every 4 seconds.

## Final Project: Sequence Generators

Generates random sequences of notes based on a Markov chain model, which is then passed through a synthesizer.
