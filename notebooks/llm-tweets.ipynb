        "### Motivation\n",
        "\n",
        "Over the past year or so, the field of generative artificial intelligence has seen a huge rise in popularity. In particular, large language models (LLMs) that have been trained on unprecedented amounts of data can process langauge and respond to user inputs at a humanlike level. A prime example of this [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), a chatbot released on November 30, 2022, that can answer (almost) any question that it is given. LLMs are also used in generative AI art models like [DALL-E](https://openai.com/research/dall-e) and [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/), which can turn any text imaginable into realistic images. With the increasing availability of these tools to the general public, it is becoming easier than ever to utilize these LLMs without much technical experience. In fact, many have praised them for being revolutionary and believe that they will only improve over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, the use of these models have also been at the center of countless debates. There have been heated discussions about whether AI-generated art that \"steals\" work from actual artists can be considered real art, with controversies ranging from an image created by Midjourney winning first prize at an art contest ([link](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/02/technology/ai-artificial-intelligence-artists.html)) to using AI to save time on drawing backgrounds from scratch in animated films ([link](https://www.polygon.com/23581376/netflix-wit-studio-short-film-ai-controversy)). And ChatGPT, with its capability to perform a wide array of often very specific tasks, could threaten to replace numerous jobs over the next several years ([link](https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-jobs-at-risk-replacement-artificial-intelligence-ai-labor-trends-2023-02)).\n",
        "\n",
        "The present analysis seeks to answer a seemingly simple question: *What are people actually talking about when it comes to LLMs?* As many of these tools are currently available for public use, it makes sense to look at how everyday people (not just specialists) are interacting with them. As a case study, we will focus on the social media platform Twitter since it provides an abundant source of data that can be used to analyze the discourse surrounding LLMs."

        "Just by looking at a sample of the tweets, we notice that some tweets don't necessarily fit into *any* of the topics that we defined – remember that the model is just classifying tweets into a topic based on the highest probability. It seems that these kinds of tweets are trying to gain traction by using popular hashtags, often putting closely related hashtags in the same tweet. For example, #aiart could be paired together with #dalle2 and #midjourney (which are AI programs that can generate images from text input) not because the tweet is talking about these topics but because it is more likely to be viewed when looking up these topics.\n",

After a while, this craze died down and more people are beginning to focus on the implications of having such AI tools in their daily lives (more about innovation and impact).

To save ourselves from work, we will use a pretrained sentiment analyzer called [VADER](https://vadersentiment.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which is tuned to pick up sentiments in social media. We run this model on each tweet, getting back a compound score between -1 (very negative) and 1 (very positive). We then use this score to determine whether the tweet should be classified as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on the scoring outlined [here](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment#about-the-scoring).

        "    - There was an initial increase in tweets about LLM prompts after the initial launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, though tweets in the later months shifted towards being more about innovation and impact.\n",
        "    - These topics are not as clear-cut as initially thought; in fact, the topics have considerable overlap.\n",

        "2. *What kinds of sentiments are associated with online discussions about LLMs?*\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Tweets about LLMs tended to be more positive or neutral; neutral tweets made up a smaller proportion (around 15.9%).\n",
        "    - Over time, the distribution of these sentiments generally did not change – there were still more positive and neutral tweets compared to negative ones.\n",
        "    - When taking a closer look at legitimate tweets about LLMs (i.e., not spam), positive tweets generally praise LLMs for being revolutionary and efficient while negative tweets tend to be critical about their impact. However, the sentiment labels are a bit hazy since VADER can be prone to misclassifications."
